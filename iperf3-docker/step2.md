Find MTU size

sending a packet larger than the current MTU setting:
```
ping -M do -s 1501 -c 5 $ip
```{{execute T2}}


Sending one too large:
```
ping -M do -s 118972 -c 6 $ip
```{{execute T2}}

Expected Error: packet size 118972 is too large. Maximum is 65507

ok:
```

fail:
```
ping -M do -s 1474 -c 8 $ip

`
Routers are no longer required to perform packet fragmentation and reassembly, resulting in packets larger than the routerâ€™s interface MTU being dropped. IPv6 hosts perform PMTU to determine the maximum packet size for the entire path. When a packet hits an interface with a smaller MTU, the routers send back an ICMPv6 type 2 error, known as Packet Too Big to the sending host. The sending host receives the error message, reduces the size of the sending packet and tries again.
