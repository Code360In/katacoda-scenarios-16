[Envoy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/) is easily integrated with open source projects in order to have metrics and distributed tracing.

scenario: https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/start/sandboxes/jaeger_native_tracing.html?highlight=jaeger


All incoming requests are routed via the front Envoy, which is acting as a reverse proxy sitting on the edge of the envoymesh network. Port 8000 is exposed by docker compose (see docker-compose.yaml). Notice that all Envoys are configured to collect request traces (e.g., http_connection_manager/config/tracing setup in front-envoy-jaeger.yaml) and setup to propagate the spans generated by the Jaeger tracer to a Jaeger cluster (trace driver setup in front-envoy-jaeger.yaml).


The following scenario demonstrates how to:


- Expose Envoy's statistics in [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/).  

- Use prometheus datasource to build dashboards in [Grafana](https://grafana.com/).

- Configure envoy to send traces to [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/).

- Configure Metrics for Jaeger and Grafana dashboard.

- Use h2load to generate load to envoy.

- Use nsenter tcpdump to verify UDP msg to Jaeger
